## My process

My Process is simple. Things i know i do it myself, things i don't know or familiar with i do google search or ask in community. which is very helpful. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

media queries, flex property and mix-blend-mode property

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
#para-box {
  
  color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75); /* where a is opacity */
  
}

.main-box {
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
    margin-top: 20px;
  }

#main-small-box {
    
    letter-spacing: 1px;
   
  }

#overlay {
  
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 710px) {
  #text-box {
    
    padding: 50px;
    }
}


}
```
